### Hey there!

I'm Hiep and welcome to my blog.

I currently work on Python development and Microsoft BI certification.
Before I worked as an Finacial Data analyst at [Vietnam Construction Bank]("https://www.cbbank.vn/"). 
At Cbbank, I collaborate with a IT team to develop custom web-apps that empower centralized processes to make business decisions faster and risked managable.

As a financial data analyst, my roles have ranged from developing traditional paper reporting to online financial dashboard and maintained the ETL infrastructure -- all while working closely with our internal and external stakeholders to cultivate a relationship.

I've also a co-authored of research papers about financial behavior of investor in [cryptocurrency]("https://civisanalytics.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HC_HPV_2019_digital.pdf").

I graduated from Maastricht School of Management - the Netherland in 2019 with a Master degree in Business and Administration speciliazed in Financial and Accounting; and a Bachelor in Business Administration from Hoa Sen University - Viet Nam .

When I'm not professionally nerding about data science, you can catch me experimenting in the kitchen, investment in cryptocurrency, and explore Swiss mountains.
