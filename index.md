### Hey there!

I'm Hiep and welcome to my blog

I currently work on Python development and Microsoft BI certification.
Before I worked as an Finacial Data analyst at [Vietnam Construction Bank]("https://www.cbbank.vn/"). 
At Cbbank, I collaborate with a IT team to develop custom web-apps that empower centralized processes to make business decisions faster and risked managable.

As a financial data analyst, my roles have ranged from developing traditional paper reporting to online financial dashboard and maintained the ETL infrastructure -- all while working closely with our internal and external stakeholders to cultivate a relationship.

I've also a co-authored of research papers about various topics in healthcare, such as how persuasive messaging can [crytocurency]("https://civisanalytics.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HC_HPV_2019_digital.pdf").

I graduated from Maastricht School of Management in 2019 with a Master degree in Business and Administration speciliazed in Financial and Accounting; and a Bachelor in Business Administration from Hoa Sen University.

When I'm not professionally nerding about data science, you can catch me experimenting in the kitchen, investment heavily in cryptocurrency, ENS, or explore Swiss mountains.
