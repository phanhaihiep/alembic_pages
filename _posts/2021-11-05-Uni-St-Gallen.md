### What it is
Switzerland offers the best education system in the world, in term of quality, facility, practical experience and flexibility. With a pleasure, I would bring you to a Elite Business School in Switzerland name University of St. Gallen, it is top 1 business school in Switzerland and has long history in their reputation name.

I went to an Information day to check it out and would be attempt to prepare for the future learning path. The favorite of mine is Master of Banking and Finance or Master in Quantitative and Economics.

The information day agenda is pretty clear and well-structure, firstly conduct a general introduction and then campus-tour and lastly each program will have 1 hour to explain more in details. Choose the program you like and just walk in.

### Testimonial:
Pros:

• State of art programs, elite students and professors, modern facility: green space, large hall, hug library, gym and sport hall.

• Tuition is ridiculous good.

• All programs were teaching in English.

• Career Center is a big plus to bridge you with potential employer.

Cons:

• All programs require at least some work experience and if you are too much experience can considering over-qualify.

• Working-permit is difficult, after study time, your visa will be expired. As the school mentioned they also help to prepare a working permit but you should consider as a factor.

### Final words:
I have heard friends take about University St. Gallen, majority they mentioned positive and here today with my own eyes and first impression, I must come here to learn. Despite strictly permission of entry and location distance, I could have it a go by applying for a pre-assessment.
