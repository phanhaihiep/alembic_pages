### Project: Karel the Robot

1. what to learn: functions, code blocks, and while loops.
- define functions
def my_functions():
- call the functions
my_functions()
- identation in python: using space or tab
- while loops
while something_is_true
  #dosomething repeatedly
for example: 
  number_of_hurdles = 6
  while number_of_hurdles > 0:
    jump()
    number_of_hurders -= 1
    print(number_of_hurdles)

- while not at_goal(): # while not is also a condition to stop the jump
    jump()

- for loops when you know the number of loops and while loops when you dont know the how many but you know the condition true or false
