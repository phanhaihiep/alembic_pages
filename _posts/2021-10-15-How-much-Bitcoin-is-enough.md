### How much #Bitcoin  is "enough?"

First, I would define “enough”. Enough to achieve your life goals, enough for your own ego, enough to be financially independent, enough to give your family a helpful financial support.

When  #BTC  moves firmly back into price discovery above 70k then every holder will experience #FONE ~ Fear of not enough.

Actually it is, the Bitcoin supply circulation will be 21 million. We wouldn’t be able to get more than this number. Realistically devided everyone population in the world by 21 million. Then decide how much of that you would like to own/have influence over. The given number is 0.26 #btc ~ 260,000 sats (21 million divided by global population). So that anything above that is is a win.

### So how much #Bitcoin  is "enough” to MAKE it in life?

Supposing you "retire" on 2030 or after and we reach hyperbitcoinization AND that you can get a 4% real yield on your Bitcoin to have the equivalent of $50,000 dollars a year... I would say something like 0.12 Bitcoins is enough. And 0.26 Bitcoins return $100,000 a year is sufficient good.

> Scenario 1:

10M$ * 0.12 = 1.2M$

1.2M$ * 0.04 = 48k$ / year

> Scenario 2:

10M$ * 0.26 = 2.6M$

2.6M$ * 0.04 = 104$ / year

Lets get off 0, fam!
